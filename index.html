    <div class="modal-body">
      <div class="popup-form">
                    <p class="mb-3">In Indian health insurance industry alone, it is estimated that around 30% of claims
                      are fraudulent. According to studies conducted by FICCI and Indiaforensic, 31% of medical bills
                      and documents submitted for the purpose of securing health insurance claim have been found to be
                      fraudulent. The increase of fraudulent health claims is posing a challenge to insurers in claim
                      settlement pace. With emergence of hardcore insurance frauds, even paper hospitals, the need for
                      claims investigation is indispensable than ever.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">The steep increase in the fraudulent claim is a pain point that hampers the claims
                      settlement process altogether and threatens the incurred claim ratio and the financial strength of
                      the insurer. The huge volume and geographical spread of claims and proves an obstacle for SIU`s
                      (Special investigative units of insurers) to control this menace.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Furthermore, it would be impractical and financially unviable for the insurer to
                      deploy SIU`s at every part of the state. VR Assurance address this particular pain point for
                      multiple insurers by deploying a network of credible claim investigators at each district for the
                      states of Kerala and TamilNadu. Our investigators are qualified paramedics who are well trained in
                      hospitalization claims investigation. On intimation from the nearest SIU of insurer, our software
                      scans through our investigator network and allocates the case to the investigator closest to the
                      claimant. Our Investigator physically visits the hospital and checks the veracity of the claim. We
                      check for both hard frauds (frauds committed by claimants) and soft frauds (frauds committed by
                      hospitals with or without consent of claimants).</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                      <span>The value that we provide includes:</span><br>
                      <span>Best turnaround time in claims investigation industry</span><br>
                      <span>Well qualified and professionally competent investigators</span><br>

                      <span>Lower claims outgo and enormous savings in claims for the insurer</span><br>
                      <span>The reports are submitted to insurer with facts and observation of the investigator along
                        with recommendation of approval or rejection. Our reports are compliant with standards

                    <p class="mb-3">With advancement in technology, multiple methods of defrauding an insurer have emerged. Collusion between insured and claimant, exaggerated claims made by claimant, driver/vehicle swapping, fake accidents and addition of passengers for the sole purpose of insurance claim are some of the ways by which motor TP fraud happens.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">We offer a comprehensive solution for fighting motor TP frauds. Our state-of-the-art IT system finds inconsistencies between various documents when uploaded in the system. Our investigator network is spread throughout Kerala and TamilNadu. As soon as we receive a case, our IT system allocates the case along with red flags to the nearest available investigator. Our investigation team is spearheaded by Retd Dysps and Ex-police personnel. We not only collect the relevant records from concerned authorities but also ensure that accident spot investigation is conducted and verify the actual events from witnesses wherever possible.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">For high value cases we make sure that the income provided in petition is verified and any inconsistencies are immediately brought to the notice of the insurer. All of our reports are triple checked for quality and submitted before end of TAT (Turn around time) provided by the insurer. Our IT system enables us to customize formats of the report as desired by the insurer.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">We have handled more than 7000+ motor TP cases and have a proven record for detecting false cases as well as substantiating our repots with conclusive and irrefutable evidence.</p>
